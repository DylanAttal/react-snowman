-Make three rows of letters that will be the last things on the page
-Make a place for the snowman pictures that will be the first thing
-Make a place for the blanks that will be the second
-Make the program choose a random word from the json file
-Make the number of blanks the same length as that word
-Make the letters clickable (make them buttons)
-Once the buttons are clicked, they are either
--grayed out and disabled or just disappear
-Once a button is clicked, display the next snowman image
-Once a button is clicked, see if it should go in a blank
--and put it in a blank if it should
-Make a win game mode where all the letters were guessed before
--the snowman was built
-There is no losing option. You just keep guessing letters until
--you have guessed them all.
-Make a reset button that will (for now) use the reload page way
--of resetting things
